1. The engine is still a work in progress. Notes are included for next steps. 

2. Player needs to be implemented with all possible player actions that can be taken. 

3. Play needs to be implemented with AI player organization through multiple different types of competitions.

Code is presently very clean and I would like to keep it that way. If there's interest to participate in development, we may discuss. This is a hobby project and updates will occur when I have time between finishing my PhD.
